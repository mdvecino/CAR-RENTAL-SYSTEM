# 🚗 Car Rental System (In Development)

This is a command-line based **Car Rental System** developed in **Python** with **SQLite3**, created as part of an assessment for the *Professional Software Engineering* subject in my Master’s programme.

The system simulates key features of a real-world car rental application using **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, a **modular structure**, and a **local SQLite database**.
